# PredictionsUnderSleepRestriction
We investigated the impact of sleep restriction on learning and inhibitory control 
in a predictable yet uncertain environment, focusing on built-up expectations. 
Using a Go/NoGo task with varying Go-stimuli probabilities, 
we compared Sleep-Restricted (SR) and Well-Rested (WR) participants. 
Both groups showed similar performance trends, 
but WR adapted better to changing probabilities. 
Surprisingly, we found no group differences in inhibitory control. 
A computational model revealed SR participants had diminished 
perception of environmental volatility, suggesting challenges 
in detecting task changes and updating beliefs.
